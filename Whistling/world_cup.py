"""World Cup: whistle-drive the car as the "ball" or the "goalie".

Driving works exactly like note_drive.py (same calibration, pitch detection,
noise filtering and live spectrogram). This adds the game around it:

    WAITING   the car ignores whistles until "start" arrives on ME193/Rogers
    PLAYING   whistle to drive
    WON/LOST  motors stop, whistles are ignored and a song plays
              until the next "start", which begins a new round

MQTT ("start" always comes from ME193/Rogers):
  - Results are JSON on ME193/Rogers:  {"event": "goal", "team": "cucurella"}
      goal = that team's ball scored,  fail = that team's ball was caught
    Only messages whose "team" is the opponent (--team) count; others are
    printed and ignored. Our ball publishes the same JSON with --my-team.
  - Plain-text "goal" / "fail" on ME193/<opponent> are also accepted.

Ball (calibrates a 5th note, GOAL):
  - light sensor sees the goalie up close -> publish "fail", death song
  - hold the GOAL note for GOAL_HOLD_SECONDS -> publish "goal", success song
Goalie:
  - opponent's "fail" -> success song
  - opponent's "goal" -> death song
With two computers the remote laptop plays the same song as the host.

The light sensor counts the ball as caught when its reflection reading rises
--catch-delta above the baseline measured at startup for --catch-frames
screen updates in a row (anything close in front of it reflects its light).

Calibration is saved to world_cup_calibration.json next to this script.

Usage:
    python world_cup.py --role ball              # calibrate, connect car + sensor, wait for start
    python world_cup.py --role goalie --use-saved
    python world_cup.py --role ball --dry-run    # no motors or sensor
    python world_cup.py --role goalie --team cucurella   # opponent is team cucurella
    python world_cup.py --send start             # publish a test message and exit
    python world_cup.py --send goal --team cucurella     # pretend cucurella's ball scored
